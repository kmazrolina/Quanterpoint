## About this project

First of all, we would like to point out that we've performed the application which is developed over the quantum paradigmi. We used a 1-qubit central processing unit which generated 12 complex numbers and then we used a discrete dynamical system describing the Julia set/ Julia fractal. Those iterations described via Julia fractal were highly important for generating music tones. 

Our solutions are highly innovative because we've been using a special dynamical system that generates random numbers and it's described by Julia set. Secondly, we performed highly detailed applications over a quantum paradigm.
