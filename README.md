About that project
First of all we would like to point that we've performed the application which is developed over quantum paradigma. We used 1-kubit central processing unit which generated us 12 complex numbers and then we used discrette dynamical system describing Julia set/ Julia fractal.  Those iterations described via Julia fractal were highly important for generating music tones. 

Our solutions are higly innovative because we've been using special dynamical system which generates us random numbers and its described by Julia set. Secondly, we performed highly detailed application over a quantum paradigma.
