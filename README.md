## About this project

# Quantum Harmony: Exploring the Quantum Soundscape

Our work brigns the realms of quantum physics and music composition closer together in a symphony of innovation and creativity. This project draws inspiration from the audacious composers of the past who sought to infuse their music with the elegance of physics and mathematics

Quantum Harmony is an exploration of the intersection between quantum computing and music composition. It combines cutting-edge technology with artistic creativity to produce unique minimalist music inspired by the principles of quantum physics.

## Project Stages

### 1. Quantum Circuit Creation

We start by crafting 12 distinct quantum circuits using Qiskit, a leading quantum computing framework developed by IBM. Each quantum circuit represents a unique musical element in our composition.

### 2. Real Quantum Execution

Taking a bold step into the quantum world, we execute these 12 quantum circuits 1024 times on a real quantum computer. Each execution provides us with measurements of quantum bits (qubits) as either 0 or 1. This quantum data forms the basis of our musical creation.

### 3. Base of Melody

From the quantum data harvested, we derive "the base of melody." By calculating the percentage of times each qubit was measured as 1 and how many times it was measured as 0, we lay the groundwork for our musical composition.

### 4. Frequency Generation

Using the base of melody as our guide, we apply a julia fractal algorithm to generate a series of 8 numbers. These numbers represent musical notes or frequencies and serve as the core of our composition.

### 5. Music Composition

We use a guitar string simulation to transform the generated frequencies into an 8-note melody. This melody resonates with the ethereal essence of quantum computation and forms the core structure of our musical composition.

### 6. Minimalist Music Inspiration

Drawing inspiration from the minimalist music compositions of acclaimed artists like Steve Reich and Philip Glass, we introduce simple counterpoint melodies. These counterpoint melodies complement the quantum-generated melody, creating a dynamic and captivating soundscape.

### 7. User Interface and Composition

Our user-friendly interface empowers users to engage with the quantum world of music composition. Users can select samples, experiment with different combinations,
